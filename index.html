                <h1>Biography</h1>
                <p>During Sergey Brin’s time at Stanford, the internet was just beginning to take its place as a major player on the international telecommunications stage. The primitive search facilities of the time ranked search results by how many times any given search term appeared on any given page. This method was easy for bad actors to game, and the results were often mostly irrelevant to the queries.

                    Larry Page thought he could improve on this system by coming up with a way to determine the number of external web pages linking to any page. He figured that its number of external links would be a good heuristic for how useful a page was. In order to realize this ambitious idea, he needed the help of an expert data miner like his classmate, Sergey Brin.
